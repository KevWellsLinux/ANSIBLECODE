 ansible example -m ping -u [username]

…where [username] is the user you use to log into the server. If everything worked, you should see a
message that shows www.example.com | success >>, then the result of your ping. If it didn’t work,
run the command again with -vvvv on the end to see verbose output. Chances are you don’t have
SSH keys configured properly—if you login with ssh username@www.example.com and that works,
the above Ansible command should work, too.


Ansible assumes you’re using passwordless (key-based) login for SSH (e.g. you login by
entering ssh username@example.com and don’t have to type a password). If you’re still
logging into your remote servers with a username and password, or if you need a primer
on Linux remote authentication and security best practices, please read Chapter 10 - Server
Security and Ansible. If you insist on using passwords, add the --ask-pass (-k) flag to
Ansible commands (you may also need to install the sshpass package for this to work).


Let’s run a more useful command:

$ ansible example -a "free -m" -u [username]



ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml  playbook-02.yml -u kevin
